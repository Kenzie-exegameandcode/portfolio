        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Mackenzie Barlow, and I’m currently in my third and final year of a BA in Game Design and Development, a journey I began in 2022. Ever since I can remember, I've had a deep passion for design. However, I wanted to create something more interactively tangible, something that could bring joy to people's faces. This desire led me to the fascinating world of game design.

            Throughout my studies and personal projects, I've had the opportunity to create numerous games and work with a variety of software tools and platforms, including VSCode, Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, Photoshop, and GitHub, among others. My experience spans across different genres and technologies, from first-person shooters and multiplayer games to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), landscaping, third-person games, and 2D side-scrollers.
            
            In addition to game development, I’ve also explored various scripting languages such as C++, C#, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Each project has taught me new skills and solidified my belief that passion is the key to creating something truly remarkable. Whether I'm designing a game or coding, I strive to infuse my work with enthusiasm and creativity.
            
            This portfolio is a showcase of some of my creations, highlighting my journey and the skills I've honed along the way. My career goal is to continue designing and problem-solving to ensure that everything I produce offers an enjoyable user experience. I believe that by combining technical expertise with a heartfelt passion for creation, I can create interactive experiences that resonate with players and bring smiles to their faces.
            
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it!</p>
